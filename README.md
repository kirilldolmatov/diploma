## Abstract

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) allow to create unique content, including images that are indistinguishable from real ones. One of possible GANs application is generation of images to increase training sample size. One of the issues related to medical images analysis is difficulty of obtaining sufficient data to build predictive models. In particular, this issue exists in the area of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). This is due to strict embryo culture conditions that do now allow image capturing and confidentiality of the data. Previously published paper reports successful generation of cleavage stage embryo images. but there were no studies generating blastocyst stage images. Importantly, blastocyst stage is one of the key stages in ART cycle as embryo quality is assessed and its fate is decided during this period. In this work I have generated realistic images of blastocyst stage images of desired quality using StyleGAN2-Ada architecture. Obtained results are the first of their kind and can be used in various computer vision tasks that analyse blastocyst stage embryo images.
